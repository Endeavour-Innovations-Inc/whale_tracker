Forked from Dapp University my version of Whale transactions tracker for TONIC token on Cronos Chain.

There are errors present retrieving whale transactions still needs work on that functionality by changing the threshhold value.

Compared to the Dapp University code, my code includes plenty of comments to help facilitate teh understanding of the code functionality. 

Future plans include expanding the functionality of retrieving the whale transactions on different tokens. Also there are plans to expand the functionality of obtaining the 
transactions type such as staking, burning, selling into stables and etc.
